Reflections:

• What did you hope to learn but did not?
    I was hoping to learn a bit more about hadoop or other containerization services like that.  I did not necessarily expect them to be mentioned, but it would have been nice.
    
• What did you really enjoy learning about?
    I really liked learning about OAth, I had always wondered how that technology worked and it seems very useful.

• What worked well in the course? and how?
    The in class assignments, although sometimes a lot of work, gave us a lot of exposure writing code in these languages and were good primers for the homeworks

• What did not work well in the course and how might it be improved?
    There was a huge amount of coursework, and some areas went a bit too fast in my opinion.  

• What could I have done to help you more, presentation of material, design of in class exercises, goals of projects – and be specific please!
    I think maybe more exposure to basic javascript/design patterns in js at the beginning would have been more useful than some of the lectures on modern technologies we just touched on briefly.  I struggled a lot with the game project and still don't feel very comfortable with normal js.

• Anything else you like to say?
    It was a really interesting class, I learned a lot, thanks!
