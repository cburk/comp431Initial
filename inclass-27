1. Which presentation was the most polished and delivered, and why?
I think the presentation about angular 4 deserves this title.  It was very well rehearsed, clearly presented,
and the presenter answered the question about differences between it and the js flavors we've been using in
a way that demonstrated knowledge of the technologies.

2. Which topic did you learn the most from and what did you learn?
I learned from the presentation on native vs web apps that there are interesting tradeoffs made in choice of
platform.

3. Which talk did you like the best and why?
I thought the discussion on cookies and advertising was interesting.  I like hearing about the cat and mouse
kind of games that organizations play with dueling technologies like this.
